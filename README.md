# gender-glasses-shirt-detector
This project is a modular pipeline built in Python to identify **Gender**, **Glasses presence**, and **Shirt Color** from a given image. It combines the power of deep learning (`PyTorch`), pose estimation (`MediaPipe`), and color clustering (`KMeans`) to analyze a person's appearance from a photo.
